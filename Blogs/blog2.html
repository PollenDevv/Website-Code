        <h1>How to get out of tutorial purgatory abyss</h1>
        <p>
          When starting programming it's easy to think that programming is just about typing words on a screen,
          but when in reality that is only a small part, the main part of programming is problem solving and 
          design choices.
          <br><br>
          So when you start programming it can be very overwhelming, so what do you do? You look up a tutorial or 
          follow a guidebook, this is fine but the problem comes when you keep using tutorials, again and again. 
          At what point are you following a tutorial instead of programming yourself, it also takes away trying to 
          complete a solo project by yourself.
          <br><br>
          The easiest ways out ot very simple: stop using tutorials, unless its new and you have to watch a tutorial, or you don't 
          know the syntax, you generally don't want to use a tutorial. But you may be stuck trying to code. There may be a couple of reasons
          <ul>
            <li>Don't have an idea of what to do, in that case try <a href="blog1.html">my first blog</a></li>
            <li>Don't know how to go about it. what you want to do is break it into smaller pieces, I will have a blog on that soon</li>
            <li>Don't know the syntax, in this case you kind of go against what I've been saying but just for syntax, you can look up a tutorial as I mention earlier in the blog</li>
          </ul>
